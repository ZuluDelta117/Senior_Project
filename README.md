# Senior_Project
This is a project that when compleated will demonstrate some of the things I have learned through my collage career such as ability to plan and create project within a specified time line. Ability to work through bottlenecks, errors in code, and ability to code complex structures. 

## Project Description
A mobile application that will allow for a user to search and store recipes. The user will also be able to create a meal plan using the recipes stored and then based on the meal plan add ingredients into a grocery list.

### Introduction:
This project will allow a user to keep all their recipes in one place where it will be easily accessible, while also making meal planning and grocery shopping easier. 

### Purpose:
The target for this application is families that do not have a lot of time to meal plan. This application will make keeping record of meal planning and grocery lists made easy. It will also help people use ingredients that they have before they go bad. 

### Scope:
Due to the time constraint this project will focus on the functionality on the application and not the UX of the application. It will allow users to search, filter, and sort a database, but the design will not be the focus of the application. Design meaning the logo, pictures, color pallet, other features that does not affect over all functionality though it may affect the user experience.  

### Technologies Used:
This project will be using Android Studio for the front end with Java, VS code will be used when writing the backend in Python. I will be using the relational database MySQL that will be hosted in the cloud using AWS RDS.
